# caveman — statusline badge script for Claude Code
# Reads the caveman mode flag file and outputs a colored badge.
#
# Usage in ~/.claude/settings.json:
#   "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/caveman-statusline.sh" }
#
# Plugin users: Claude will offer to set this up on first session.
# Standalone users: install.sh wires this automatically.

# the terminal every keystroke.

# same hardening as the flag file (a local attacker could plant a file with
# ANSI escape codes otherwise). Until /caveman-stats has run at least once,
# the suffix file is absent and nothing is rendered — so the default is safe
# for fresh installs (no fake number, no crash).
